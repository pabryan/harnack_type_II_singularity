\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Hamilton's Harnack implies Type II singularities blow up to translating solitons. Can also split out all lines to obtain $\R^k \times M^{n-k}$ with $M^{n-k}$ strictly convex. Is it also compact? ref? The conjecture is that $M^{n-k}$ is rotationally symmetric. 
\item To pick up rotational symmetry, use the non-collapsing two-point function $k(x,y)$. If we can prove a Harnack inequality for this, with equality occurring precisely on rotationally symmetric solitons, then similar arguments above for the translating solitons might prove the conjecture!
\item For translating graphs we can calculate easily $k(x,y)$ and it constant in time, $\partial_t k = 0$. Transforming to the mean curvature flow parametrisation we then will obtain $\partial_t k + A = 0$ for some quantity $A$. See Ben Andrews change from Gauss parametrisation to mean curvature flow parametrisation. This will give us the quantity 
\[
\chi = t(\partial_t k + A) + \delta k
\]
as the basic Harnack quadratic to study. We should also be able to derive $A$ by
